## 📚 Covered Design Patterns
We’ve covered and implemented the following design patterns so far:

1. **Strategy Pattern** — Behavioral  
   Allows selecting an algorithm’s behavior at runtime.  
2. **Observer Pattern** — Behavioral  
   Defines a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.  
3. **Singleton Pattern** — Creational  
   Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.  
4. **Decorator Pattern** — Structural  
   Dynamically adds new behavior to objects without modifying their code.  
5. **Template Method Pattern** — Behavioral  
   Defines the program skeleton of an algorithm, letting subclasses override specific steps.

## 🧠 About the Project
This repository aims to simplify **Design Patterns** concepts using clean, well-structured Java examples.  
Each pattern includes:
- Clear and organized code  
- Explanation linked to the YouTube video  
- Practical use case demonstrating when and why to use it
